            Since the first skateboard made There are no teams and no rules. When someone skates well, we all win! You can do it almost anywhere. Most do it in the streets but if you are lucky you have a skatepark to go to.
            
            Skaters are free to skate how they want and do the tricks they want. There are no other players to influence what you do. This independent, no rules, free thinking mentality attracts creative people to skateboarding. The kind of people who like to do their own thing.

The culture surrounding skateboarding is filled with independent and sometimes very opinionated skaters. The attitude of the skater often reflects the era when they started skateboarding. The young ones are so good and have such a great energy.

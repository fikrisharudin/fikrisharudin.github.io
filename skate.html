                  <p>In the period of 1940s till 1960s, the first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. It was an idea by Californian surfers in which they felt like doing something as similar as surfing when the waves were flat </p>

                  <p>Skateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding. Most boards are about 7 1‚ÅÑ4 to 8 inches (180 to 200 mm) wide and 30 to 32 inches (760 to 810 mm) long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. </p>
